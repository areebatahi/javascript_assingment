        Nike is a champion brand builder. Its advertising slogans—“Bo Knows,” “Just Do It,” “There Is No
        Finish Line”—have moved beyond advertising into popular expression. Its athletic footwear and clothing have
        become a piece of Americana. Its brand name is as well-known around the world as IBM and Coke.

        So it may come as a surprise that Nike, the consummate marketer, came to understand the importance of marketing
        late in its life: after it hit the $1 billion revenue mark.
        <span id="moreText" style="display: none;">
            After more than a decade of meteoric growth, Nike misjudged the aerobics market, outgrew its own capacity to
            manage, and made a disastrous move into casual shoes. All of those problems forced the company into a period
            of intense self-examination. Ultimately, says founder, chairman, and CEO Phil Knight, the company realized
            that the way forward was to expand its focus from the design and manufacture of the product, where Nike had
            always excelled, to the consumer and the brand.

            Nike’s roots go back to a company called Blue Ribbon Sports, which Knight, a former runner at the University
            of Oregon, and Bill Bowerman, Knight’s former track coach, created in 1962. Blue Ribbon Sports started out
            distributing running shoes for a Japanese company, then shifted to designing its own shoes and outsourcing
            them from Asia. Blue Ribbon Sports’s performance-oriented product innovations and mastery of low-cost
            production translated into shoes athletes wanted to wear and could afford. Knight and Bowerman’s track
            connections got the shoes onto the feet of real runners. And then jogging emerged as a new national
            pastime.
